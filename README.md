# LaunchDarkly-Demo
> Simple implementation of a Feature Flag to deliver a single line of response in an Express app.

This is a basic demo of how a Feature Flag would work in a Node//Express app.

## Steps

1. Create your Trial account with [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/).
2. Create a new feature flag called `my-demo-feature`.
3. Leave this as a Boolean with two variations (true|false).
4. Check that the default value is set to `true`
